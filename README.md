# Ignition Node-RED Module

## Overview

Adds support for Node-RED nodes by adding an API to an Ignition Gateway. The API allows for the reading, writing, and browsing of tags configured in Ignition.

## Configuration

Once the module is installed, you must add an API Key and Secret that allow access to the API. You can administrate these tokens in the Ignition Gateway configuration page under Node-RED -> API Tokens.

## Requirements

- Ignition 8.1.25+  (Select prior branch for 7.9 or use release 1.5.11 for versions prior to 8.1.25)
- Node-RED (node-red-contrib-ignition) nodes installed
